## Introduction to Hadoop
Hadoop is an open-source software framework used for storing data and running applications on clusters of commodity hardware. It provides massive storage, enormous processing power, and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks or jobs.

## Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
HDFS is the primary storage system used by Hadoop applications. It provides high-throughput access to application data and is designed to scale out from a single server to thousands of machines.

*Read more in the `hdfs.pdf` file.*

## MapReduce
MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.

*Read more in the `mapreduce.pdf` file.*

## Rack Awareness
Rack Awareness is a Hadoop feature that takes the rack information into account when scheduling tasks and placing data. It ensures data is placed in a manner that improves data processing speed and fault tolerance.

## Getting Started
To get started with Hadoop, follow these steps:
1. Install Hadoop: Download and install Hadoop on your local machine or a cluster.
2. Configure Hadoop: Set up configuration files for your environment.
3. Upload Data: Use HDFS commands to upload data to the Hadoop file system.
4. Run Jobs: Submit MapReduce jobs to process data in HDFS.
5. Monitor: Use Hadoop's web interface to monitor job performance.
